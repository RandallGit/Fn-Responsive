Why another framework you ask?
------------------------------

Bloated CSS frameworks like bootstrap made everything look and feel the same and [littered my mark-up with presentational classes](http://www.doidea.se/techblog/more-semantically-correct-html-with-less-and-bootstrap "Title") . It was like someone sent me in the web wayback machine to 2000. You are the Weakest Link! Goodbye! So I created a lightweight foundation of parts I liked and created the missing links.

This is a hodgepodge of parts and techniques I admit AND they have worked for many projects. This has been the foundation of prototpyes all the way to projects wrapped in Cordova deployed in app stores.

*Leverages the easiest to use CSS Preprocessor LESS
*Bakes-in a grid system strategy using Semantic.gs. using a technique that abstracts the grid from your markup using the LESS magic rub
*Provides a Variables file to create your color scheme, button styles, box shadows and other stylistic needs
*Typographic rhythm baby!
*Use any number of grids with gutters or not
*Includes a Normalize file to make browser styles consistent instead of reseting
